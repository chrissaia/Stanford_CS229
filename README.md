# Concept-Overview — Stanford CS229 (End-to-End Notebook Reconstruction)

This repository is a **ground-up reconstruction of Stanford CS229 (Machine Learning)** as a sequence of **Jupyter notebooks (Lesson 01 → Lesson 20)**.

This is **not** a summary repo. Each lesson is designed as a **teachable, executable chapter** with:

- deep intuition
- correct math (CS229-style derivations)
- minimal but correct NumPy implementations
- high-quality visualizations and diagnostics
- explicit connections across lessons

The sequence follows Stanford Engineering Everywhere’s CS229 lecture topics and handouts.

## What You’ll Get From Each Lesson

Each notebook is standalone, but also part of a coherent sequence.

Every lesson follows the same structure:

1. **Title + Goals**
2. **Intuition / Theory**
3. **Math** (MLE, objectives, gradients, etc.)
4. **Minimal implementation** (NumPy-first)
5. **High-quality visualizations**
6. **Diagnostics / sanity checks**
7. **Extensive “Key Takeaways”**  
   - when to use the method  
   - failure modes  
   - bias/variance behavior  
   - practical debugging tips  
   - connections to later lessons

## Repository Philosophy

### 1) Implement the CS229 Version
If Andrew Ng derives something a certain way, this repo implements **that version** (or something similar), explains *why* it works, and sometimes where it fails.

### 2) NumPy First
We avoid library abstractions whenever possible.  
`sklearn` is used only for:
- loading datasets
- optional baseline comparisons

### 3) Debuggability Is a Feature
Every major algorithm includes:
- loss curves
- sanity checks on toy data
- at least one failure-mode demonstration

### 4) Visualizations Are First-Class
Decision boundaries, probability surfaces, contours, margins, and diagnostics are part of the explanation — not decoration.

## Quickstart

### Option A — Run Locally (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrissaia/Concept-Overview_StanfordCS229
cd Concept-Overview_StanfordCS229

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

pip install -U pip
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter scipy pandas
```

Then:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
