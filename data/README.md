# Data directory

This folder is reserved for small CSV datasets used in the notebooks.

## Included
- `energy_efficiency.csv`: local dataset already committed to this repo.

## Adding external datasets
If a notebook references an external dataset (e.g., Kaggle), download it manually and place the CSV in this folder. Keep file sizes small and document the source in the corresponding notebook.
